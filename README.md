## How It Works
1. The user inputs a URL or text in the input field.
2. When the **"Generate QR Code"** button is clicked, the application sends a request to a public API to generate the QR code.
3. The QR code is displayed below the input field.
4. If the input field is empty, the input box shakes to notify the user to enter some text or URL.
